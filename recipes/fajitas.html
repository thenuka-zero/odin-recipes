        <p>Fajitas are a popular Tex-Mex dish consisting of grilled meat, typically beef or chicken, served on a flour or corn tortilla. The meat is usually marinated in a blend of spices, lime juice, and oil before being grilled or saut√©ed with onions and bell peppers. Fajitas are commonly served with a variety of toppings and accompaniments, such as guacamole, sour cream, salsa, shredded cheese, and pico de gallo, allowing for a customizable and flavorful experience. The sizzling platter of fajitas is often brought to the table in restaurants, adding an exciting sensory element to the meal.
            The origins of fajitas can be traced back to the ranches of South Texas, where Mexican ranch workers created the dish from skirt steak, a cheaper cut of beef. Over time, fajitas gained popularity in the United States, evolving into the dish known and loved today. Variations have expanded to include shrimp, pork, and even vegetarian options using ingredients like grilled portobello mushrooms. Fajitas are not just a dish, but a social meal, often enjoyed with family and friends due to their interactive, build-your-own nature.

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        <ul>
            <li>3 boneless skinless chicken breasts</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>3 bell peppers , thinly sliced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
            <li>1/2 lime</li>
            <li>Fajita seasoning packet</li>
        </ul>
    <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Make fajita seasoning. Add the fajita seasoning ingredients to a small mixing bowl and stir together.</li>
            <li>Season the chicken. Generously sprinkle the fajita seasoning on both sides of the chicken and use your fingers to press it into the chicken.</li>
            <li>Cook the chicken. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Sear the chicken breasts for about 7 to 8 minutes on each side.</li>
            <li>Slice the veggies. While your chicken is cooking, cut the bell peppers and onion into thin slices.</li>
            <li>Cook the veggies. Once the chicken has finished cooking, remove it to a plate and let it rest for a couple of minutes. Add the bell peppers and onion to the same skillet over medium heat and saute for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently.</li>
            <li>Slice the chicken. When the bell peppers are just about done sauteing, slice the chicken breasts into strips. You can slice those pieces in half again for thinner strips of chicken.</li>
            <li>Mix and serve. Add the chicken back into the skillet, add a squeeze of fresh lime juice and stir everything together. Serve immediately with tortillas and extra toppings such as sour cream, pico de gallo and guacamole.</li>
        </ol>
